- The things will be built in JavaScript or whatever.
- Node.js
- Express.js (node module?)
- Test main module with mocha/chai

Some facts:
- 1 second (real time) = 1 minute (game time) and so on.
- There is a day and night cycle

Dirt Farm initial setup:
- 5m x 5m Farm
- 1 unit of reagronomized dirt per second
- 10 units of reagronomized dirt per click
- $100 investment from your really nice grandma
- your family compost heap (for nutrient mush supply)
- dirt quality: 1 (regular dirt quality is 0)

- going rate for good dirt: $10/gram

Dirt Farm benchmarks of success:
-
- Environmental equilibrium achieved: you win
- All humans dead! Problem solved? Vacuously true.

Dirt Farm upgrades:
- Nutrient mush supply:
  - other compost heaps
  - corpses of pets
  - corpses of people
- Dumb Farm:
  - neighborhood kid labor ($2/hr, nGoodDirt/hr (you are immoral but effective))
  -
- Smart Farm:
  - automated tiller
  - climate controlled greenhouse

- Different sized packaging means you can only sell dirt in specified quantities
- Container price(to customer) based on contents
- Container price(to self) a flat rate (have to pay for the container and the shipping)

Equation for selling:
profit = (dirtUnitPrice * containerVolume) - shippingCost;

larger containers cost more, but the cost per unit of dirt is ultimately less expensive.

box 10 units of dirt, unitPriceOfDirt = $1, shippingCost = $3 (unless you get a better deal)
10 u of dirt * $1 per unit = $10 - $3 shipping = $profit

Shipping quantities:
  - box:
  - bucket:
  - coffin:
  - big box:
  - shipping container:
